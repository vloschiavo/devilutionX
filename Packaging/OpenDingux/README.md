# DevilutionX OpenDingux Port

-vloschiavo@gmail.com:  copied the edits that ManuelSch81 made on his git repo against the current state of diasurgical/devilutionX.
This gets a few additional fixes and features and gives us multiplayer on the RG350/RG350M/RG350P.

See README.md in the root directory for build instructions.
